## how to run this </br>






## why make this? </br>
I love listening to Soundcloud beats, every Soundcloud artist has a producer tag, in my opinion they hype & spice up the song so much.
When I run or do any sport activity while listening to music, I sometimes just imagine certain producer tags in a beat not made by the producer, this program is now attempting to solve this very uncommon inconvinience.

The term "Fulcrumification" comes from the name "fulcrum" also known as "[damianluck925](https://www.youtube.com/@damianluck925)", an american youtuber, who films himself smoking the penjamin in public.
He has created multiple catchphrases such as "[FULCRUM, COMING, UP!!! YODIEGANG, YOU FEEL ME?](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FULCRUM)", and additionally adds sound snippets such as "fulcrum is a codename, we give to our secret informants".


## temp DEV NOTES </br>

<h3>required libraries: </h3> 

- tkinter (gui)
- pydub (framework/library for easy audio management)
- ffmpeg (editing)
- yt-dlp

Hopefully I can just use pyinstaller to make it into an .exe and avoid prerequired libraries to be manually downloaded.
